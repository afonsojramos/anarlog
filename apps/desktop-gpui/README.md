# Native GPUI preview (ANLG-320)

This is an opt-in, standalone native package. The existing desktop app remains the
shipping application and the behavior reference. This package starts from
`6adf6f0d1ccdf72a5ceeb2313466a5a98cd0eeb8`; no implementation from PR #7683 or its
branch was transplanted.

## Run

Use the repository's Rust toolchain and run from the repository root:

```sh
cargo run --locked -p desktop-gpui
# Or select a disposable profile / backup copy:
cargo run --locked -p desktop-gpui -- --profile /absolute/path/to/sandbox
```

The default is `$HOME/.anarlog-gpui-sandbox/library.sqlite` (Windows:
`%USERPROFILE%\.anarlog-gpui-sandbox\library.sqlite`). There is no automatic
discovery or migration of the shipping application's live profile. `--profile`
is a directory, not a database filename. Only use an isolated directory or a
consistent SQLite backup; do not copy a live WAL database's main file alone.
The canonical schema is prepared with `db-app`. CloudSync starts disabled and
requires account sign-in, encryption setup and explicit enablement.

The integrated preview mounts the native workspace, TipTap JSON editor,
transcript/audio pane, and concrete cloud/local product services. The editor
autosaves through a background journal; save conflicts retain drafts. The note
header opens transcript/audio, share, and export surfaces. Recording, recovery and
AI use the selected provider, secure credentials and running local models.
Missing configuration produces an error; credentials are never fabricated.
Transcription and intelligence settings expose provider/model/base-URL choices
and a masked API-key input. Keys save separately to the system keyring; provider
choices use an atomic CAS transaction. Local models are selected by starting
them through the model manager.

Cloud sign-in requires `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` at build
or runtime. `VITE_API_URL` and `VITE_WEB_APP_URL` can select another deployment.
The native sandbox uses separate keyring namespaces. Local engine executables
and bundled CLI/skills are resolved under `ANARLOG_NATIVE_RESOURCES` (or the
`resources` directory beside the executable); models are stored under the isolated
profile. Argmax also requires `ARGMAX_API_KEY`.

Pinned tabs are restored and saved with CAS through `app_settings.gpui_pinned_tabs`
inside the isolated profile. Malformed persisted pin data disables pin writes.
This does not import the shipping application's file-based pinned-tab store.
Title/editor/product drafts gate navigation and quit. Window close, the native
Quit control, native application-menu quit and the quit keyboard shortcut flush
all note windows, stop/finalize capture, and await runtime drain. Failed saves
retain drafts and keep windows open. OS-forced termination remains outside this
guarantee; GPUI's generic shutdown callback has a 100 ms timeout.

Published `gpui = "=0.2.2"` is used without a fork or patch. On Linux, GPUI needs
X11 or Wayland, a working Vulkan device/driver, xkbcommon, fontconfig, and FreeType.
Build-only verification does not establish that a particular GPU/desktop works.
macOS and Windows require their native toolchains and platform validation.
Use Ubuntu 24.04 or a matching recent PipeWire SDK: Ubuntu 22.04's 0.3.48 SPA
headers cannot compile the repository's `libspa 0.9.2` dependency. The native
Linux CI uses Ubuntu 24.04 and never launches a display or audio device.
The tray also needs GTK 3 and the AppIndicator runtime/development packages.

The shared lockfile also changes existing resolutions: GPUI pins macOS
`core-foundation` to `0.10.0`; its `cbindgen` requires `toml >=0.8.8`, resolving to
`0.8.23`/`toml_datetime 0.6.11`; `proc-macro-crate 2.0.2` pins an incompatible
datetime version, so the resolver selects `2.0.0`. The GPUI utilities' `nix`
requires `libc >=0.2.186`, resolving to `0.2.189`. Attempts to retain the old
versions were rejected by Cargo. Verify the existing desktop's native platform
builds against these shared resolutions before integration.

## Architecture

- `main.rs` owns CLI/profile selection and the native window.
- `application.rs`, `application_services.rs`, `native_events.rs` and
  `note_window.rs` own service construction, pane/window routing, shared
  capture/playback, recovery, persisted pins, menus/tray/shortcuts/deep links,
  update barriers and the close/drain flow.
- `ui/` provides source-derived light/dark HSL tokens, the system font policy,
  embedded existing logo and Hugeicons, focus restoration, and a bounded native
  text input with UTF-16/IME entry points and clipboard operations. Single-line
  fields are bounded at 4096 bytes; multiline catalog fields at 128 KiB.
- `workspace/` has separate shell, virtual list and note entities. A list refresh
  does not reparse or replace the selected document. List and note reads use
  cancellation plus monotonically increasing request generations; stale results
  cannot replace the current view. A previous page remains visible while loading.
- `desktop-runtime` owns a two-thread Tokio executor on a separate coordinator
  thread, a 64-item FIFO admission queue and canonical DB services. SQL, disk I/O,
  parsing for document saves and transaction execution happen there, never in
  rendering or text replacement. Accepted writes survive dropped receivers.
  Queue saturation is an explicit `Busy` result; it never silently drops a write.
- Data reads reuse `db-app`. Atomic writes/CAS use `db-execute`. Reactive queries
  use `db-reactive` rather than recreating its invalidation rules.
  Dependencies are table/view/FTS-level, not row-level. The foundation watches
  `sessions` only, then refreshes the bounded current page. No global settings,
  templates, contacts or document reload is attached to this signal.
- `QueryWatch` coalesces replaceable snapshots in one watch slot. Errors use an
  eight-item reliable queue; overflow records a terminal error and terminates
  that subscription. At most 32 watches can be live per runtime. Callers must
  inspect both channels and `terminal_error()`.
  `unsubscribe().await` is the canonical hard delivery barrier.
- `shutdown().await` rejects new admission, drains all accepted work, runs
  registered flush participants and closes the pool before acknowledging.
  Flush participants run on the runtime and must not enqueue back into the
  closed queue. Normal window close awaits this acknowledgement. OS-forced
  termination and GPUI's time-limited application-quit path cannot guarantee it.

`DocumentSnapshot.body` preserves exact stored bytes and unknown fields.
The isolated native runtime uses one pooled SQLite connection. SQLite's commit
hook can notify a reactive reader before a large WAL write becomes visible to
another connection; serializing acquisition makes refreshes wait for the writer.
Watches also suppress identical snapshots. Increasing the native pool size needs
a verified post-commit delivery barrier first.

Library navigation caches at most eight aligned pages (456 rows each), bounded
by an 8 MiB payload estimate. A separate read-only SQLite connection checks
`PRAGMA data_version` before serving a page and invalidates on committed writes,
including writes from another process. The canonical query materializes a
bounded ID page before indexed row lookups. It still scans/sorts without a
canonical composite expression index; no schema change is made. Run the ignored
release fixture in `crates/desktop-runtime/tests/performance.rs` for raw cached,
uncached and reference samples; these are not whole-application measurements.

## Remaining parity and validation gates

No GUI tests were authorized for this integration. Visual/focus/drag/drop/IME
parity, native accessibility, i18n, macOS/Windows, hardware/provider/keyring
behavior and signed packaging/update installation remain unverified. GPUI 0.2.2
lacks the required integrated accessibility hooks, a Wayland shortcut portal and
per-window close-to-hide support. Cloud attachment transfer/hydration, image
resize handles and full multiline soft wrapping remain incomplete. Shared-note
previews retain source JSON but do not hydrate published attachments. This is
not release-ready and does not switch the shipping default.
Several generic side-effect settings remain guarded, including autostart,
device lock, app/dock appearance, analytics and crash reporting. Native
localization, complete provider enrollment/model discovery, spellcheck and
keyboard/drag-selection parity still need work.

`save_document` is an explicit JSON-document API, not a lossless editor
implementation: it verifies the root and CASes the original body, format and
timestamp, but cannot prove that a caller retained every unknown node. The editor
lane must preserve unknown data and refuse unsafe transformations. CAS failures
must retain the dirty draft and expose reload/merge recovery.

## Module contracts

All modules are registered in `lib.rs` and mounted by `application.rs`.
The following contracts and ownership boundaries were used by the five fresh
implementation lanes. Their shared wiring now lives in the host modules above.

### Path ownership

| Owner | Exclusive paths |
| --- | --- |
| Workspace | `apps/desktop-gpui/src/workspace/**` |
| Editor | `apps/desktop-gpui/src/editor/**` |
| Meeting | `apps/desktop-gpui/src/meeting/**` |
| Product | `apps/desktop-gpui/src/product/**` |
| Runtime | `crates/desktop-runtime/src/**`, `crates/desktop-runtime/tests/**`, `apps/desktop-gpui/src/runtime_bridge.rs`, `apps/desktop-gpui/src/platform/**` |
| Final integrator | Root/shared manifests and lockfiles, all CI, `apps/desktop-gpui/{Cargo.toml,build.rs,README.md,scripts/**,assets/**}`, `src/{main.rs,lib.rs,contracts.rs,ui/**}`, `crates/desktop-runtime/Cargo.toml` |

Workspace can create `workspace/theme.rs` for application-specific layout or
theme state, but must consume common `ui::theme::Theme`, not duplicate token
values. Existing domain crates and existing desktop/web/mobile code are outside
every lane's write ownership. Needed changes/extractions there, including
transport-neutral Tantivy, go to the integrator with the exact proposed patch.
No lane changes schema, credentials, release defaults or security policies.

### Shared symbols

Imports below are public from the `desktop_gpui` and `desktop_runtime` libraries:

```rust,ignore
use desktop_gpui::contracts::{
    LaneContext, EditorInit, EditorEvent, MeetingIntent, MeetingEvent,
    ProductRoute, ProductEvent, WorkspaceEvent,
};
use desktop_runtime::{
    RuntimeHandle, Profile, Reply, Services, CancellationToken, Generation,
    SessionId, DocumentId, HumanId, AttachmentId,
    SessionSummary, LibraryQuery, LibraryPage, OpenSession, DocumentSnapshot,
    RenameSession, SaveDocument, LoadState, ServiceError, QueryWatch,
};
```

`LaneContext { runtime: RuntimeHandle }` is cheap to clone. Immutable snapshots
use `Arc`; resource IDs are typed strings so imported IDs are not forced into a
UUID format. `LoadState<T>` distinguishes pending/ready/error/unsupported and
retains previous snapshots. `Reply<T>::receive().await -> Result<T>` can be
awaited by a GPUI task; it does not require a Tokio runtime on the UI thread.

`RuntimeHandle` APIs:

```rust,ignore
start(Profile) -> std::io::Result<(RuntimeHandle, Reply<()>)>
library(LibraryQuery, CancellationToken) -> Result<Reply<LibraryPage>>
open_session(SessionId, CancellationToken) -> Result<Reply<OpenSession>>
create_note(Arc<str>) -> Result<Reply<OpenSession>>
rename_session(RenameSession) -> Result<Reply<OpenSession>>
save_document(SaveDocument) -> Result<Reply<DocumentSnapshot>>
watch_library() -> Result<Reply<QueryWatch>>
watch_query(String, Vec<serde_json::Value>) -> Result<Reply<QueryWatch>>
submit(FnOnce(Services) -> SendFuture<Result<T>>) -> Result<Reply<T>>
read(CancellationToken, FnOnce(Services) -> SendFuture<Result<T>>) -> Result<Reply<T>>
register_flush(FlushParticipant) -> Result<Reply<()>>
shutdown().await -> Result<()>
```

`submit`/`read` are worker entry points, not UI SQL APIs. Domain-specific
typed operations belong in runtime submodules. Independent long-running service
work uses a 16-item queue with at most four concurrent jobs, separate from the
serialized database coordinator.
`register_flush` must be acknowledged before starting a durable producer.
Cancellation is for superseded reads, never an accepted authoritative write.

### Constructors and event routing

Each constructor below returns `Self`, called through `cx.new(|cx| ...)`.
Views implement GPUI `Render` and the indicated `EventEmitter<Event>`.
Subscribe with `cx.subscribe` and retain the `Subscription`.
Workspace also implements `Focusable`; use its focus handle for
`EditorInit::return_focus`.

| Lane | Public constructor |
| --- | --- |
| Workspace | `workspace::WorkspaceView::new(LaneContext, Reply<()>, &mut Window, &mut Context<Self>)` |
| Editor | `editor::EditorPane::new(LaneContext, EditorInit, &mut Window, &mut Context<Self>)` |
| Meeting | `meeting::MeetingPane::new(LaneContext, MeetingIntent, &mut Window, &mut Context<Self>)` |
| Product | `product::ProductPane::new(LaneContext, ProductRoute, &mut Window, &mut Context<Self>)` |
| Runtime | `runtime_bridge::start(Profile) -> std::io::Result<(RuntimeHandle, Reply<()>)>` |

The integrator starts the runtime once, gives the readiness reply only to
workspace, and clones `LaneContext` into every other pane.

- Workspace emits `WorkspaceEvent::OpenEditor { session_id, document }`,
  `Meeting(MeetingIntent)` and `Product(ProductRoute)`. The final integrator
  creates/focuses the corresponding pane. Workspace owns session/folder
  selection, tabs, navigation history, search, contacts, calendar, templates and
  automations. It does not own document JSON or recorder internals.
  The host handles editor, meeting, product, shared-preview and standalone-window
  routes and forwards saved-note/capture events to automation execution.
- Editor receives `EditorInit { session_id, document, return_focus }`. It emits
  `Dirty { session_id, dirty }`, `Saved(DocumentSnapshot)`,
  `SaveFailed { session_id, error }`, `OpenLink(Arc<str>)`,
  `OpenAttachment(AttachmentId)` and `MentionHuman(HumanId)`.
  Dirty/save failure is authoritative and must not be coalesced away.
  The integrator handles external navigation and close guards. Native selection,
  rich text, UTF-16 mapping, IME/CJK, history, menus, clipboard, attachment
  insertion, lossless unknown nodes, concurrent sync and autosave belong here.
  The shared single-line input is not the rich-text editor.
- Meeting receives `MeetingIntent::{Open(SessionId), Start { session_id }, Stop}`.
  It emits `Recording { session_id, active }`, `OpenSession(SessionId)` and
  `Failed(ServiceError)`. The intent enum is a request, never proof that capture
  started. Runtime/audio workers must acknowledge start/stop and durable final
  transcript events. Meeting owns devices/capture, live partial/final words,
  speakers, retention including Never, recovery, playback/waveform, summaries and
  local/hosted AI execution. Keep transcript delivery reliable and partial UI
  snapshots coalesced independently.
- Product receives `ProductRoute::{Onboarding, Permissions, Settings, Account,
  Billing, CloudSync, Share(SessionId), Import, Export(SessionId), Models,
  Integrations}`. It emits `NavigateWorkspace`, `OpenSession(SessionId)` and
  `Failed(ServiceError)`. Auth/E2EE/settings orchestration, imports/exports and
  product integration state belong here. Never represent an unavailable
  provider, permission, license or secret as successful.
- Runtime owns paths/profile policy, native platform adapters, reactive
  subscription lifecycle, cancellation, startup/drain barriers, localization and
  accessibility foundations, and release-build instrumentation/fixtures.
  `platform::WindowRole::{Main, Settings, MeetingOverlay}` and
  `PlatformEvent::{DeepLink(String), Shortcut(String), OpenMainWindow,
  Failed(ServiceError)}` define the native boundary. Concrete adapters are
  installed by the host; unsupported platform cases remain explicit errors.

### Assets and theme

`build.rs` derives all HSL colors from
`packages/design-system/src/tokens.css`. The shared radius is 8px. The CSS RGBA
keyboard-shadow tokens are not yet native shadow primitives.
`ui::theme::SYSTEM_FONT` selects `.SystemUIFont`, `Segoe UI` or Linux
`sans-serif`; font metrics still require platform comparison.
The existing logo is embedded directly. Hugeicons SVGs are generated from the
repository-pinned `@hugeicons/core-free-icons` package:

```sh
node apps/desktop-gpui/scripts/export-icons.mjs
```

Keep generated SVGs checked in so Rust builds do not require Node. Ask the
integrator to extend the generator/asset map for additional icons. Do not add
an unrelated icon family or replace the repository font policy.

## Verification and remaining gates

```sh
cargo check --locked -p desktop-gpui
cargo build --locked -p desktop-gpui
cargo test --locked -p desktop-runtime -p desktop-gpui
cargo clippy --locked -p desktop-runtime -p desktop-gpui --all-targets --no-deps -- -D warnings
find apps/desktop-gpui crates/desktop-runtime -name '*.rs' -print0 | xargs -0 rustfmt --edition 2024 --check
cargo tree --locked -p desktop-gpui --edges normal,build --target all
```

The runtime tests use temporary databases only, covering durable reopen,
opaque JSON preservation, CAS conflict and deleted-document rejection,
queue saturation/drain, flush barriers, cancellation and reactive unsubscribe.
Input model tests cover UTF-16, grapheme deletion and composition-relative ranges.
These do not validate native input methods or accessibility. Integration coverage
also exercises rich-document save/reopen through `SaveJournal`, preservation of
opaque/table/task content, competing writes, explicit conflict resolution, and
pin CAS/corrupt-storage behavior.

`pnpm dev:desktop-gpui --profile /absolute/path/to/sandbox` runs the native binary.
`pnpm check:desktop-gpui` runs the native check, tests, and Clippy. The focused
`desktop_gpui_ci.yaml` additionally builds the binary and checks Rust formatting.

Equivalent release-build old/new profiling with reproducible large-library,
large-document and streaming fixtures is required before claiming any speed,
memory or responsiveness improvement. A successful Linux build is only a
build-viability result. See the remaining parity and validation gates above.
